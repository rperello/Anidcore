Anidcore
====

Anidcore is a PHP micro framework built upon RESTFul and HMVC.

**IMPORTANT NOTICE:**
This framework is in an early development stage (some features are still Work-In-Progress).
This means that code is not stable and is not recommended for a production environment.

**Requirements**
> * PHP 5.3 or greater
> * Apache 2.2 or greater with mod_rewrite and mod_include (not tested on other HTTP Servers)
> * MySQL 5 or greater for the 'admin' module

**Technologies / Features:**
> * Hierarchical MVC (with subcontroller support)
> * Hooks / Event handlers (Observer pattern)
> * CLI mode support
> * RESTFul oriented controllers
> * JSON-RPC client & server & JSONP
> * Oauth 2.0 consumer & provider
> * I18n support for urls and strings
> * Cache system (file, memcache)
> * Log system (file, session flash message)
> * PDO abstraction layer and ActiveRecord pattern classes
> * Official generic CMS framework

**Credits**
> * Slim and Kohana frameworks for PHP (which inspired me on writting Anidcore)
> * Twitter Bootstrap, jQuery, jQuery UI, Modernizr and Glyphicons (used in the demo app and the admin module)
